# Design in the AI Era

**Date:** February 9, 2026

## The Core Principle

**"品味是护城河"** — Taste is the moat.

When AI makes creation accessible to everyone, what separates great design from mediocre?

**Answer:** Judgment. Vision. Taste.

## The Shift

### Traditional Design Process
Research → Personas → Journey Maps → Problem Statements → Solutions

This linear process is being questioned. The video "Why Designers Can No Longer Trust the Design Process" (Hatch Conference) explores this disruption.

### AI Era Reality

AI can execute the process. What it can't do:
- Know what's **good**
- Know what's **right**  
- Know what's **worth making**

## The New Designer Role

From **executors** to **directors**:
- Curators of possibilities
- Judges of quality
- Visionaries of direction
- Keepers of taste

## How to Drive AI for Quality

Saber's insight:
> "怎么驾驭AI做出high quality有独特调性的产品，这样的能力和想法也很重要"  
> "The ability to command AI to create high-quality products with unique character — that's crucial."

### The Meta-Skill

1. 🎯 **Clear vision** — Know what tone/character you want
2. 📝 **Precise articulation** — Translate "feeling" into AI-understandable language
3. 🔄 **Effective iteration** — Know how to adjust, refine, guide
4. 🎨 **Consistency** — Maintain unique "voice" across outputs
5. 👑 **Curation** — Pick the right one from a thousand options

## The Paradox

```
Can use AI ≠ Can make good products
Understand AI + Have taste + Can direct = High-quality unique products
```

## What Doesn't Get Automated

- Your aesthetic preferences (warm colors, minimalism)
- Your expression style (concise, powerful)
- Your judgment criteria (what counts as "good")
- Your iteration direction (where to steer)

## The Key Insight

AI is a tool. Taste is the compass.

Technology lowers the barrier to creation.  
Aesthetics raises the bar for excellence.

*The designer's job isn't disappearing — it's evolving from maker to curator, from executor to visionary.*
