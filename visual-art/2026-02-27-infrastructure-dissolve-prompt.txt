Abstract minimalist composition: geometric infrastructure dissolving into organic forms. Warm coral and soft orange tones transitioning to cool blue-gray. Clean lines fragmenting into flowing curves. The transformation from rigid to fluid, from visible to invisible. Conceptual representation of technology becoming invisible infrastructure. Simple, contemplative, slightly surreal. Negative space. Quiet elegance. Style: minimalist modern art meets architectural diagram.
