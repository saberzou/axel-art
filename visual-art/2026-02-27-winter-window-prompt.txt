A minimalist composition of a single window glowing with warm amber light against a deep twilight blue background. Soft, diffused glow suggests someone inside, contemplating. Simple geometric shapes, muted warm color palette (amber, ochre, dusty rose against indigo and navy), conceptual and atmospheric. Style: contemporary minimalist illustration with a painterly quality, emphasis on mood over detail. The feeling of quiet solitude and gentle introspection on a late winter evening.
